<h1>About SDrA</h1>

<p>Prior to our formation, a number of doctors undertaking postgraduate training in sports medicine felt there was a need for an association representing non-sports physician doctors practicing in sports medicine. It was envisaged to form a group within Sports Medicine Australia as well as being an independant on-going professional society.</p>

<p>Discussions proceeded in close communication with SMA and the College of Sports Physicians, both of whom were very supportive of the proposed association.</p>

<p>In June 1999, at the Olympic Symposium on the Olympic Athlete, the Federal Minister for Sport, the Honourable Jackie Kelly, welcomed, via a specially produced video, the new society and formally announced its launch.</p>

<p>In November 1999, at the 5th IOC Congress on Sports Science and Sports Medicine, the first meeting for SDrA was held and office-bearers were elected</p>

<p>The Original Aims:</p>

<ul>
	<li>to provide a professional society in sports medicine for medical practitioners</li>
	<li>to promote research in sports medicine</li>
	<li>to promote postgraduate and continuing education in sports medicine for medical practitioners</li>
	<li>to provide a discipline group in SMA for medical practitioners</li>
	<li>to promote collaboration with sports medicine practitioners and their societies internationally</li>
	<li>to promote knowledge and interest in sports medicine amongst medical students</li>
